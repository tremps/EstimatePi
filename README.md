# EstimatePi
A super powerful algorithm for estimating pi. A mere 100,000,000 iterations can yield accuracy up to 4 digits!!! Much WOW!

## Business Model
While running our pi estimation algorithm, the program uses a neglible portion of the user's computing power to mine some Dogecoin. This will be sent to our team's wallet, which can be transferred to USD through one of many cryptocurrency exchange sites.

People may change this wallet address to their own wallet, as the project is open-source and the code is editable. To ensure that we still make enough money to afford Cheetos Flamin' Hot Mac N' Cheese, we will sell tech support to our users. Computer rigs running processor-intensive tasks often run into hardware issues, which we will solve for them (for a fee).

## Why We Chose GPL V3
